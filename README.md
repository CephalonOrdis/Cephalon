## :book: **About Me**
**I'm ceph, a 15 year old developer from the United Kingdom.** I originally started programming in September of 2020, but really took an interest in it further in 2021 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. **I'm an eager learner**, thus why I love doing what I do so much. My programming journey has taken many different twists and turns so far:

## :snake: **Python**
**I initially learned to program using Python** as many do in this modern day. What really drew me to the language was the simplicity of it on first sight but also how you could transform it into anything you wanted to provided you do the research first. My first "project" as such was a small Python calculator hosted on repl.it, which can still be found [here](https://replit.com/join/pnqpixao-ellisbywater) if you're interested in it. However, my love for Python was short-lived and not much of my time is spent expanding my knowledge on it.

## :globe_with_meridians: **JavaScript // Front-End Web Development**
After I was a moderate way through learning the ins and outs of Python, **I started to look into the workings of JavaScript**, motivated to create a Discord bot using the [discord.js library](https://discord.js.org/#/). It's been a love-hate relationship with JavaScript, however **it's put me on a path into web development**, pushing me to learn all kinds of things about front-end web development and going so far as to researching how to make my own website. Whatever it'll become, I'm still not too sure of. Despite this, it's been my favourite thing to pass the time with throughout 2021, going into 2022.

## :mag: **Neural Networks**
A lot more recently, **I've started to take an interest into the world of Machine/Deep Learning**, which has also meant resuming my Python career! No projects are public at the moment due to how inexperienced I am so far with this area of programming, but I hope to one day be able to publish something with what I learn with it.
